            <h3>
                Advantages to owning a BMW
            </h3>
            <p>
                BMW is known for being ‘the Ultimate Driving Machine’ because they offer the best in performance, luxury interiors and the latest technologies. They are known for their power and performance because of their turbocharged engines, dynamic transmissions, and hyper responsive steering. All of which makes driving a BMW fun and thrilling. BMW is a luxury car that is known for how fast they can drive while hugging the curves of the road. Quick acceleration, extra safety features, smooth shifting and rear wheel drive all set BMW rides apart from not just other cars, but other foreign made vehicles.

                Safety is something that these cars are known for. They consistently receive the “Top Safety Pick” awards from several organizations which means that lots of test dummies have lost their lives just to prove how safe they are. The latest models have all of the latest safety features and technologies and are constructed out of a combination of aluminum and high-strength steel. That means that if you ever get into a collision, your car will hold up much better than most of the cheaper made vehicles out there.

            <h4>
                Things to consider when buying a BMW
            </h4>
            <p>
                With all cars, no matter the make and model, there is always going to be something on the downside to consider when purchasing one. BMW is no different. While they may be one of the most popular car brands in the world, they are also known for being unreliable and pricey when it comes to repairs, parts, and maintenance. The main reason they are rated as one of the most unreliable cars on the market is that the makers of BMW seem to put all of the emphasis on performance rather than reliability.

                When you consider buying a car, one of the most often overlooked things considered is how much, how often and how long it takes to get your car regularly serviced. BMW has a reputation for being more expensive than its competitors in this department, so you may want to look into how much time and money you’ll be looking at if you have, or are considering purchasing, a BMW.

                One last thing to mention when talking about owning or buying a BMW is that though it has all the fancy bells and whistles of the latest, most up to date technology, the upkeep on said technology can put a dent in your finances.

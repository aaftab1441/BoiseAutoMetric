                Mercedes Benz Specialists | Foreign Car Experts of Boise, Idaho
            </h1>
            <h2>
                You and Your Mercedes Benz
            </h2>
            
            <p>
If you are one of the many people who ride in style driving a Mercedes-Benz, you may have noticed that your car isn’t just a run of the mill, standard machine. In fact, it’s probably why you chose to buy it in the first place. Mercedes-Benz as a whole states luxury, style and class. As a luxury car owner, there are a few things to keep in mind concerning how to keep your car running smoothly and how to ensure that you don’t unexpectedly find yourself in need of putting your car in the shop. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Pros and Cons of owning a Mercedes Benz 
            </h3>
            <p>
While your car may ooze posh sophistication, which is definitely a pro, there are a few things that some may consider as a con to owning or purchasing a Mercedes Benz. When considering what kind of a car to buy, many people ponder buying a used car first since the cost of the car can be much lower than buying a car fresh off the lot. An older Mercedes Benz could actually be a great thing. In the 80’s and 90’s they produced cars that could last a lifetime and were of excellent quality. That means that if you chose to buy a used Mercedes Benz, you saved yourself thousands of dollars by avoiding both the more expensive price tag of a brand new model, but also in the initial depreciation of value that happens as soon as you drive off the lot. 

 

That’s not to say that they don’t still make good cars, but there have been some models in more recent years that didn’t quite make that cut. Even with a few models that haven’t quite lived up to the hype, they still produce vehicles that have the latest technologies as well as still being one of the best luxury cars on the road. The fact that the makers of your car endeavored to make the best in car luxury, doesn’t mean that there aren’t a few cons to owning one.

            <h4>
                The cost of owning a Mercedes-Benz
            </h4>
            <p>
                Though luxury and style may say ‘money’, driving a car that exemplifies that could also mean the same thing when it comes to repairs and maintenance. It’s a well-known fact that maintenance and repair costs are higher on luxury vehicles than on their non-luxury counterparts.  

 

The good news is that with a regular maintenance schedule, i.e. making sure that you get the oil changed regularly, checking all of your fluids in the engine, transmission and cooling system, you can keep the costs down. Here at Boise Auto Metric, we can help you establish a schedule for that maintenance. Since we are a local repair shop, we’ll be able to help you keep your hard earned money in your wallet instead of paying the higher prices that you would at a dealership.

            <h5>
                Issues that Mercedes-Benz are known for
            </h5>
                
            <p>
            There are some issues that are worth mentioning when talking about owning one of these luxury cars. They are known for being prone to paint chipping and rust issues, so if you live down a rural road, this make of car may not be the best option for you and you may want to consider another type of luxury car.  

 

Some of the internal systems are notorious for breaking down such as the air conditioner. The window regulators, which make the window go up and down, are also known for going out frequently in these cars. It’s an easy fix, and not that expensive to repair, but it is something to consider when purchasing a new or even new Mercedes.  

 

They are also known for the air suspension system having issues on some models. Fortunately, since the issues originally popped up, there have been much more affordable options to fixing the issues found. That means that if you do encounter this problem, it won’t necessarily have you filing bankruptcy to get your car back on the road.  

 

Most people don’t even know what an engine mount is, much less what they do for your car. Rest assured that when you are having issues with this in your car, you will know it from how your car starts to drive. You will feel and notice that your car vibrates where as before it drove and rode smoothly. Mercedes-Benz vehicles often have this issue around the 100,000 mile mark, so keeping this in mind when you’re purchasing your car, or if you have already invested in one, is important as it can significantly impact the ride quality of your vehicle. 

 

One last issue to mention is that the catalytic converter in these cars are known for having issues, usually around the 60,000 mile mark. If our check engine light comes on and you can hear a rattling noise under your hood, this may be the problem.  If so, you need to get your car to an auto repair shop as soon as possible.  

 

Fortunately, Boise Auto Metric can help you with all of these issues. We are here to help you get your car back on the road and not break the bank to do so. If you need a reliable, affordable, people-friendly place to bring your car, we’re the place for you and we look forward to helping you anyway we can!
